## *Work in progress* 

### [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) for [April 7, 2020](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-04-07), a trove of data on [The Tour de France](https://www.letour.fr/en/).

This is a long post, but I put a lot of work into cleaning the data, so left all that work in. If you just want the charts, scroll down a ways.

```{r pkg load, message=FALSE, ECHO = TRUE}
# load packages
library(tidytuesdayR) # to load tidytuesday data
library(tidyverse) # to do tidyverse things
library(tidylog) # to get a log of what's happening to the data
library(tdf) # to get original stag results file

#library(patchwork) # stitch plots together
#library(gt) # lets make tables
#library(RColorBrewer) # colors!
#library(scales) # format chart output

# create notin operator to help with cleaning & analysis
`%notin%` <- negate(`%in%`)

```

There's a ton of data here, sourced from the [`tdf` package from Alastair Rushworth](https://github.com/alastairrushworth/tdf) and (Thomas Camminady's data set) (https://github.com/camminady/LeTourDataSet), via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jaminliu/a-brief-tour-of-tour-de-france-in-numbers/)

There are three distinct sets to work thru, each going back to the first run of the race in 1903:  
  * A dataframe of overall ([General Classification, or Yellow Jersey / _maillot jaune_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_classification_in_the_Tour_de_France)) winners from 1903 to 2019 comes from the Tidy Tuesday frame.  
  * A dataframe with stage winners for races 1903 to 2017, also in the Tidy Tuesday set, sourced from Kaggle.  
  * A frame of overall stage results, sourced from the `tdf` pacakge due to issues with date conversion in the data included in the Tidy Tuesday set.  

The stage winner set needs a bit of mungung...I created a stage_results_id column similar to the one in the stage results set. But it needs leading zeros for stages 1-9 so it sorts properly.

I then got it in my head I wanted results through 2020, so I grabbed them from wikipedia; but the hard way, with copy-paste since my scraping skills aren't there & I just wanted it done. Data is uploaded if you want to use it.

Stage data in CSV from tt repository seems to have truncated the times, leaving only the seconds in a character field. To get complete results we need to pull from `tdf` package using the cleaning script from the Tidy Tuesday page. Some operations will take a while. Those parts of the code commented out here so they don't run while the page kints & compiles. For analysis, I'll load in the saved rds set.

In terms of cleaning:   
  * The stage_results_id & rank fields needs leading zeros.
  * The rank field needs a bit of clean-up to fix the 1000s codes.
  * Since rider names were last-first, I wanted to separate out first and last, and also make a field with the full name, but first name in front. Stackoverlflow was my regex friend here. 
  * Other minor fixes

In the process of cleaning and comparing to the stage winners set, I noticed there were some problems in years where individual stages were split into 2 or 3 legs (A, B & C). Either while it was scraped or combined, the A leg results ended up repeating to the B leg, and in some cases the C leg wasn't reported. I put it in as an issue in the github repo. But that shouldn't take away from what's an amazing dataset to work with. In the analysis section I'll work around the problems with those stages.

Poking around the Kaggle site referenced I found this dataset of final results for all riders in all races since 1903. A few different fields than in the tidy tuesday winners set. 
```{r tt_letourdl3, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE, error= FALSE}
## overall race results for finishers up to 2020...need to figure out how to merge with tdf package sets
tdf_bigset <- read.csv("https://github.com/camminady/LeTourDataSet/blob/master/Riders.csv?raw=true") %>%
  mutate(Rider = str_to_title(Rider)) %>%
  rename(rownum = X)
```

Now this is a ton of data to work with, and I won't use it all. Figured I'd include the code to get it all in case you get inspired to grab it and take a look.

Ok, let's lok into the data and make some charts and tables. Because there's already been a fair amount of #tidytuesday twitter submissions on the set, I don't want to repeat what's already there. So to start with I think I'll focus on changes over time in how fast stages have been relative to stage type.
